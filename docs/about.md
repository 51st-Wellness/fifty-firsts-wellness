About Us
At Fifty Firsts Wellness, we believe wellness and self-care is for everyone, at every stage of life, personally and in the workplace, empowering progress not perfection. We see midlife as a time of reinvention, a time to embrace change, explore new possibilities and age well with confidence. We want to support the challenging times, like menopause or mental / physical ill health, calmly and with empathy. We challenge outdated ideas about what it means to live and age well, replacing them with a fresh perspective. This stage of life can be energising, creative and full of opportunity.
We are built on community and connection. Our work brings people together to share experiences, support one another and grow stronger through our belonging, new opportunities and life’s transitions. By combining practical tools with empowering conversations, we help individuals feel equipped to take charge of their wellbeing, build resilience and thrive, in work and life, to be stronger for longer.
We offer a suite of services, resources and a network of experts to support you on your wellness journey, wherever you are starting from. Lets get started!

Mission Statement:

At Fifty Firsts Wellness, our mission is to nurture, inspire, connect, and empower individuals and businesses on their unique wellness journeys. We support people through life's messy middles, significant pivots, and transformative moments by emphasising that wellness is about progress, not perfection. Our aim is to create a safe and compassionate space where every step, experience, and intention matters as we embrace the complexities of change, midlife transitions, health challenges, career shifts, and identity explorations.


Our Vision
Our vision is to build a world and unite a community where wellness feels:
•	Nurturing: growth grounded in strength, compassion and empathy
•	Inspiring: full of possibility, bold and uplifting
•	Connecting: designed for real people, real workplaces and real life
•	Empowering: practical, inclusive and achievable 
We’re redefining what it means to thrive in midlife and beyond, with tools that support change, reflection that sparks reinvention and programmes that make wellbeing a way of life.
Because when we nurture, inspire, connect and empower, we don’t just support wellbeing, we transform it.

Creativity helps us shape meaningful change and bring ideas to life. We believe imagination can move mountains (or at least make the climb more fun).

We’re committed to helping people take charge of their wellbeing journey. Through resources, support, and encouragement, we foster confidence, ownership, and pride. Our goal is to create an environment where everyone feels equipped to thrive, with confidence and on their own terms. We are in it together, you’re unstoppable!
