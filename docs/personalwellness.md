Personal Wellness Services
At Fifty Firsts, we believe wellness should be practical, inclusive, and stigma free. Our personal wellness services are designed to support individuals through midlife transitions, workplace challenges, and everyday wellbeing. Everything we do is grounded in community and connection, supporting longer, healthier living, shaped by our NICE framework: 
•	Nurture – We create safe, supportive spaces (virtual or in-person) where people feel seen and valued, encouraging self compassion, self-care, growth and resilience.
•	Inspire – Through storytelling, workshops and practical tools, we spark curiosity, discipline and motivation, reframing wellness, change and midlife as opportunities growth and discovery.
•	Connect – Wellness thrives in community. From walking partners to group workshops, we prioritise connection, belonging, shared experiences, removing isolation and fear.
•	Empower – We equip individuals with action plans, support, strategies and confidence to take charge of their wellbeing and make lasting change in their lives.
Support to Suit Your Self Care and Wellness Needs
Our Wellness Warrior Programme
Wellness is easier with company. Our Wellness Warriors provide advice, companionship and encouragement, whether as walking partners, career / life coaches, ideas support, gym buddies or coffee companions. This programme is about connection as much as health, reminding people that self care does not have to be a solo journey. We are in it together and you are unstoppable!
Life Coaching and One to One Support
Our coaching sessions are tailored to your goals and challenges, offering evidence based strategies for stress, energy, self-care, to help you live well, sleep well and age well. We provide a safe, supportive space to explore what’s next in your personal or professional life, wellbeing journey, menopause or midlife transitions. 
Workshops and Group Programmes
We deliver interactive sessions on wellbeing, menopause, midlife wellness, stress management, and longevity practices. Our training, webinars, workshops or wellbeing spotlight sessions blend expert insight with peer connection, creating playful, stigma free conversations that reframe midlife as an opportunity.
Wellness Ambassador Training
We train individuals to become trusted wellbeing champions within their organisations. Our frameworks combine empathy, evidence, and practical action, helping to create healthier workplace cultures.
Live and Age Well (Longevity and Biohacking) Services
We are striving to make advanced wellness strategies accessible, from physical therapy and recovery practices to biohacking tools and insights (coming soon). Our focus is on translating and embedding cutting edge science into everyday routines that support energy, focus and vitality.
Community Membership and Resources
Our community members gain ongoing access to guides, check ins and live webinars. We provide a supportive network where individuals can share experiences, celebrate progress and access practical toolkits designed to fit into busy lives.
